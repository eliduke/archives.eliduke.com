caption: "Hawaii is a beautiful place, but the struggle is real for many of the locals and native Hawaiians. What is the right thing to do? Should I just never return? Or has tourism become such a critical part of the economy that I am sort of needed in a way? It's hard to say. I'm still trying to figure it out. But, when traveling, always do your best to spend your money at locally owned businesses. It's the very least that we can do."
