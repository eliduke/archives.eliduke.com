caption: "Some good news in these dark times: we got solar panels! Turned them on for the first time about an hour ago and we are raking in the sunshine now!\n\n☀️☀️☀️\n\nIn full disclosure, we were privileged to get these for two specific reasons: 1) we own the house and 2) we have good enough credit / income for the loan that paid for them.\n\nBut, in the end, the idea is that we stop paying an electric bill and instead make a similar monthly payment on the loan. It balances out pretty well and it's cool that such options are available. I'm totally down to talk more about it if you are interested, so HMU.\n\nAlso, if the power is ever out and the sun is shining, come on over! ❤️\n\n#pdxbeehive"
