caption: "I decided to work at Just Bob coffee shop this afternoon. At one point a homeless man came in for a glass of water and the woman behind the counter offered him a free bowl of soup. He graciously declined, but it was such a nice little moment of caring and understanding in this shit storm of a world we live in these days."
