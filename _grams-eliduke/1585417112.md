caption: "As a landlord myself (#pdxbeehive), I support this 100%. You should NOT be suffering while the banks are getting bailed out.\n\nI have made it clear to my renters/housemates that they are not obligated to pay rent during these trying times, and if I end up having a hard time paying my mortgage then I will take that up with my credit union. I like to think of it as \"trickle up\" hardship.\n\nFollow @pdxrentstrike for more details.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚úäüèº‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n#rentstrike2020 #covid_19"
