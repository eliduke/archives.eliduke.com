caption: "Y'all, I'm sorta in disbelief right now. ðŸ˜³\n\nThis has been YEARS in the making: first I wired up all the overhead lighting, then we got the new electrical panel installed, then I excavated a bunch of dirt out of the crawl space (bucket by bucket), then I patched some holes in the concrete floor, then I built the wall (and wired up that electrical), and just now I got to put the last bits of the workbench together. Wow.\n\nThere's still lots to organize (now that I have the space!), but if you're ever thinking that you wish you had the tools and the shop space to work on a project of some sort, let me know! I'm excited to share this space.\n\n#pdxbeehive"
