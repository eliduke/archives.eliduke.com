caption: "Since quarantine began, trampolines have been sold out everywhere. None. Zero. Zilch. Nada. I've been scouring Free Craigslist for the last month and got my heart broken a couple times when I was THIS CLOSE! Ugh.\n\nThanks to hot tip from @samorive, I snagged this one today from an FB Buy Nothing Group. It was a beast to get dismantled and loaded in my truck, but when I got home some neighbor kids came over to help. They heard \"trampoline\" and all of a sudden there were half a dozen of them ready to go.\n\nThis is the lil pick-me-up that I needed. ❤️\n\n#pdxbeehive \n#trampolines"
