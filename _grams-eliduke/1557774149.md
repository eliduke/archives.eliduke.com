caption: "What an epic weekend, y'all.\n\nI met so many cool people, learned so many cool tricks, and fell down at least a couple times too many. These (bruised) hips don't lie!\n\nI'm feeling so much skate love right now and already making plans for next year.\n\n@moxirollerskates \n#moxiskatecamp\n#moxiskatecamp2019"
