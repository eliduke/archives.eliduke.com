caption: "Bubbles at the beach this weekend! And WOW! I had no idea that bubbles were SUCH a universal joy in this world. People (and even their pups) were keeping their distance, but old and young alike were flipping their shit over some bubbles. ❤️\n\nSince we were crashing in the van for only one night (and not at a camp ground), it was pretty easy for us to practice very good social distancing. Found a sweet stealthy spot for the night.\n\nOn the way home this morning we saw a couple \"☠️ STAY HOME ☠️\" signs AND as we were driving passed Hug Point and Arcadia Beach we saw big concrete barriers blocking the entrances to those parks. Looks like even the day-use spots are getting locked down."
