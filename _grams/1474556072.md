caption: "I was walking through the medina (old city) in Fez and decided to check out a restaurant. It wasn't really my vibe, so I left. Upon exiting that restaurant, a guy walked up to me, asked me to follow him. He led me to a another restaurant and then up a bunch of stairs to this rooftop spot. I had ate a delicious meal for about $5 and then on my way out he asked me to follow him again. This time he walked me into a little shop where I met another guy, they gave me some tea, and then tricked me into buying some blankets. Classic!"
